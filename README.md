# Multi-Objective-Inclined-Planes-system-Optimization-MOIPO-

Multi-objective optimization based on sloping plate optimization algorithm called Multi-objective Inclined Planes system optimization algorithm (MOIPO) is presented in this link. The proposed method uses the concept of Pareto optimization to identify non-dominant positions and an external tank to maintain these positions.


** In addition to the full source code of the algorithm here, in the following links, the reference article of the multi-objective version of the IPO algorithm (MOIPO) along with some articles of its applications are available.
