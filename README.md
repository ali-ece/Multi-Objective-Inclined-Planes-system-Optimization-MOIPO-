# Multi-Objective-Inclined-Planes-system-Optimization-MOIPO-
Multi-objective optimization based on sloping plate optimization algorithm called Multi-objective Inclined Planes system optimization algorithm (MOIPO) is presented in this link. The proposed method uses the concept of Pareto optimization to identify non-dominant positions and an external tank to maintain these positions.
